# algo_trading_rsi

This program seeks to use the talib (technical analysis) library to implement the intersection between the RSI line and the oversold and overbought line. The bulk of the program does not come from programming the indicator (as it has been created in the library), but rather the implementation of how the oversold and overbought regions can be used to make trades.
